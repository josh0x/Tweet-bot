# Twitter-Bot

Welcome to my GitHub project, where I've integrated the Node.js application with the Twitter API via their developer platform. This project primarily focuses on enabling users to create a tweet with text and photo using a specialized function defined within the application.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the integration of the Twitter API with a Node.js application, demonstrating how to programmatically leverage this social media platform's vast resources. In this project, I have created a function that enables users to create and publish a tweet with text and photo directly from the application, facilitating an automated, streamlined experience for users.

## Features

Authentication via Twitter's developer platform
Create tweets with text
Add photos to tweets

## Requirements

Node.js v14.x or higher
NPM v6.x or higher
A valid Twitter Developer account and a created application with access to the API keys.

## Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/project.git`

Navigate into the project directory:

`cd project`

Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Create a .env file in the project root directory. Use the .env.sample file as a reference.
Add your Twitter developer account's API keys.

## Run the application:

`node index.js`

## Usage

Once you have set up the application following the steps above, you can use the 'tweet' function in 'server.js' to create a new tweet.

`tweet("Your tweet text", "Path to your image file");`
